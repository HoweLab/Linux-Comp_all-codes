    "<h3>A couple of things to note: </h3>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "  <li>Make sure that caiman is your active anaconda environment. It should say caiman (Python 3/10/9) in the top right of your VS Code notebook.</li>\n",
    "  <li>If caiman is not active you can type \"conda activate caiman\" into the VS Code terminal at the bottom of your screen.</li>\n",
    "  <li>If for some reason the script throws an error, please restart the notebook before trying to run it again.</li>\n",
    "  <li>You can get paths easily on windows with shift + right click -> copy as path or on linux by dragging the file into an empty terminal and copying the resulting string.</li>\n",
    "  <li>File paths on windows will need an r before the path r\"myFilePath\", on linux this is not necessary.</li>\n",
    "  <li>You can run any cell in this notebook by either clicking the play button next to the cell, or selecting the cell and pressing ctrl + enter</li>\n",
